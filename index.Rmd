Welcome to my JSC370 Final Project website. Here, you can read about my research about crimes in Toronto neighbourhoods.

The website is divided into different pages

## Midterm Report

You can read about my midterm report where the datasets were analysed, and preliminary tests are done to investigate the relationships of crime rate in Toronto neighbourhoods and their demographic characteristics.

## Interactive Visualizations

There are several interactive visualizations which help you familiarize with the trends and distributions of Toronto's crime rates. 

## Final Report

Based on the "Next Steps" in the Midterm Report, new datasets are included into my analysis on what factors affect crime rates in Toronto neighbourhoods, as well as a model which predicts how crime rates change as different parameters of neighbourhoods are modified and adjusted.
