# Toronto Neighbourhood Crime - Examining the relationship between Neighbourhood Crime Rate and Demographic Data in Torontoâ€™s 140 historical neighbourhoods in 2016

## Project Description 

This research study aims to explore the relationship between crime rate and the characteristics of neighbourhoods in Toronto in 2016. Past studies showed that neighbourhood characteristics were significant factors of the crime rate of an area (Foster et.al 20101). These characteristics include: social-economic factors such as number of businesses, number of community spaces such as parks, green spaces and community centers, ease of transit access, and human factors such as community belonging and quality of local communities (Statistics Canada 20212). In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between the demographics, neighbourhood amenities and crime rate of neighbourhoods. Understanding this relationship will help the government and local communities respond more effectively against emerging crime rates, by eliminating risk factors and improving the well-being of a neighbourhood.
